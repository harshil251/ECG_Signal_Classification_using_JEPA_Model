# Overview

This dataset contains electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings from 363 individuals with suspected Brugada Syndrome. Brugada syndrome is a rare but potentially life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia disorder, marked by distinctive ECG abnormalities and an elevated risk of sudden cardiac death.

## Background

Brugada syndrome is characterized by a coved-type ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads (V1–V3), frequently accompanied by a right bundle branch block pattern. Diagnosis is primarily clinical and is based on the identification of this ECG pattern — either occurring spontaneously or induced by sodium channel blockers — along with clinical criteria such as a history of syncope, documented ventricular arrhythmias, or a family history of sudden cardiac death.
